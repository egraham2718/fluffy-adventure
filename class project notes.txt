Project folder layout:

    g27_psc01
        g27_psc01c2csff - earlier version of the project where file I/O was introduced

-------------------------------------------------


g27_psc01c3csffm (Module version):
--------------------

(After modularizing)
What we had to complete:
    initialize_content_of_files in salesmanager.py
    save_all_sales in salesmanager.py
    import_all_sales in salesmanager.py
    add_sales2 in salesmanager.py
    add_sales1 in salesmanager.py
    add_imported_file in salesfile.py
    already_imported in salesfile.py

We didn't have to complete anything in salesinput.py or main.py
In console.py we just had to add a print statement to the exit branch.

The relationship between the python files we created:
    main.py imports from console.py
    console.py imports from salesmanager.py
    salesmanager.py imports from both salesfile.py and salesinput.py
    salesfile.py also imports from salesinput.py
    salesinput.py does not import from the python files we created

g27_psc01c6oopdbgui (OOP, database, and GUI version):

filetypes.py
    class FileType 

    (sub)class SalesFile extends FileType
    (sub)class ImportedFile extends FileType
